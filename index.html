						<p class="about">Leading Ladies is a start-up non-profit Organization* that has recognized the need for mentorship, guidance and knowledge for young girls and women ages 13 - 21 in the Greater Boston area.  The Organization is established to help mentor young girls and guide them through their adolescent lives while promoting positivity and optimism for the future.</p>

						<p class="about">Leading Ladies’ goal is to create a program that is in direct response to the growing number of young girls who find themselves falling through the cracks at school, entangled with the juvenile court system or simply needing extra support in different areas of their lives. Leading Ladies offers at-risk female youth the opportunity to make a dramatic change in their lives and future. The program is positioned to be most accessible to young females who otherwise would be swept into the juvenile court system or frequent school detention.</p>
